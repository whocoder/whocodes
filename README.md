#### about me || background

full-time free-lance developer, trying to put myself through college at a late age, contributing to and supporting the open-source community when i'm able. my past projects have included various works for [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/), a server-side addon for games running on the [Source Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)), as well as various projects for quality-of-life improvements on [Old School RuneScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape). prior to this, i got my start into programming (or, scripting, rather) around the year 2009, creating [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) scripts for the children's game [Roblox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox), before later being introduced to [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) in 2012 and continuing on to make server-side [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) plugins for [Minecraft servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft_server), advancing from there to create websites to integrate with the server plugins, using a basic [LEMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack#cite_ref-LEMPHome_12-0). this continued to me creating semi-successful and profitable ventures throughout highschool, and allowed me to support my disabled mother growing up. i have continued to work with a ton of different programming languages, frameworks, and systems for a myriad of different games, websites or programs and hope to continue programming and creating things that i love for the rest of my life.

i am an avid supporter of all things open-source, and do my best to support anyone who needs help â€” if you have a question and need some help, especially if your intentions are to create something useful, i will always be here for the assist!

#### current projects || future projects

currently, i am working mostly on projects related to [Old School RuneScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape) and [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite), including some automation and quality-of-life utilities using the powerful [EthanApi](https://github.com/Ethan-Vann/EthanVannPlugins). 

i am also eagerly awaiting the official release of [s&box](https://sbox.game/) and will be working on some content for that game upon release (big big plans!) 

other than that, i spend most of my time developing websites, kiosk systems, or other software solutions for local businesses in my area, among other odd-jobs (when opportunity knocks, i answer) when able.

feel free to check out my [private instance of Gitea](https://git.whocodes.tech/) where most of my projects are actually hosted (updates are automatically pushed and synced to my GitHub repositories). i use this primarily because it allows me to have unlimited private repositories for free, and is easy to connect with GitHub! all glory to the geniuses at [Gitea.com](https://gitea.com/).
